## 2  Step-by-Step Process

1. **Choose a bank**

2. **Pre-open online (optional)**
   Complete the bank‚Äôs migrant form up to 12 months before arrival ‚Äì you‚Äôll get an application reference.
3. **Visit any branch** with passport within 30 days of landing. Take reference (if pre-opened) or walk-in as new customer.

5. **Receive account details** (BSB + Account No.) instantly; debit card arrives at address in \~5 days.
6. **Register online/mobile banking** while still in branch (staff can help). Set 4-digit PIN for card.
7. **Deposit cash** or transfer funds to avoid dormant-fee flags.

## 4  Fast FAQ

* **Can I open without a TFN yet?** Yes. Give it to the bank later to avoid withholding tax on interest.
* **Do I need an appointment?** Not usually ‚Äì walk-ins accepted, but book online if you prefer shorter wait.
* **Which bank is best?** CBA has the largest branch network; Westpac partners with selected ATMs globally; NAB offers no monthly-fee account even after promo; ANZ has strong app UX. Pick whichever has a branch near your hostel.
* **Changing address?** Update in the app or at any branch ‚Äì required within 14 days of moving.

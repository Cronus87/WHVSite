## 4  While Waiting

* Check hostel front-desk mail box daily; TFN letter is thin A4 envelope from “Australian Taxation Office”.

## 5  After You Receive TFN

1. **Record it securely** – add to Secure Wallet in the app; do **not** share publicly.
2. Provide TFN to employer via **Tax File Number Declaration** form – HR will lodge to ATO.
3. Add TFN to bank profile (internet banking → settings). Avoid 45 % withholding tax on interest.
4. Keep TFN for life – even if you leave Australia, same number applies on return.

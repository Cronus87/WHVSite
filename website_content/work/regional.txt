## 5  Know Your Rights & Pay

* Must earn at least **Award wage** (casual farm rate ≈ \$28 hr or piece‑rate averaging same).
* Receive **weekly/fortnightly payslips** showing hours, tax, super.
* Employer must sign **Form 1263** (or online log) confirming each day worked.
* Keep payslips + bank statements + photos as evidence – upload to Secure Wallet.

If underpaid or unsafe, contact **Fair Work Ombudsman** (free, confidential). Refusing unsafe work is legal – ask for proper PPE.

## 6  Logging the 88 Days

1. Work must be **full days** (7–8 hrs) or equivalent piece‑rate hours.
2. **Calculate calendar days**, not hours – part days don’t count.
3. **Public holidays & weekends** count if the job normally includes them and you are paid.
4. Use a tracker app (88th Day) or spreadsheet – note date, ABN, postcode, hours, supervisor signature.

> Finish early? Keep working until you have a margin (e.g. 90–95 days) in case of counting errors.

## 7  Applying for Second / Third Visa

* Submit online in **ImmiAccount** before current visa expires.
* Upload payslips, bank statements, Form 1263 / employment references.
* Pay visa fee; expect grant within a few days to weeks.
* Choose to start second visa immediately or later (if outside Australia).

* Travel with friends to share fuel & accommodation.
* Always **confirm pay rate & accommodation cost** before starting.
* Beware “accommodation first, job later” scams – verify work exists.
* Keep screenshots of job ads in case employer deletes listing.
